- 
- Solidity compiler

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/McNeill90/dxmCoin.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your Ethereum development environment.

3. Compile the smart contract using the Solidity compiler.

4. Deploy the smart contract to your Ethereum network of choice.
